              - ## Security Update Process
             
              - When we receive a security bug report, we will:
             
              - 1. **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions
                2. 2. **Audit code** to find any potential similar problems
                   3. 3. **Prepare fixes** for all releases still under maintenance
                      4. 4. **Release new security fix versions** as soon as possible
                        
                         5. ## Preferred Languages
                        
                         6. We prefer all communications to be in English or Chinese.
                        
                         7. ## Disclosure Policy
                        
                         8. We follow a coordinated disclosure policy. Once a security vulnerability has been reported:
                        
                         9. 1. The vulnerability will be confirmed and analyzed
                            2. 2. A fix will be prepared in a private repository
                               3. 3. The fix will be released and announced publicly after a reasonable period
                                  4. 4. Credit will be given to the reporter if desired
                                    
                                     5. ## Security Best Practices
